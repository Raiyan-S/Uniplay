            <section>
                <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
                <p>In today’s streaming landscape, users are overwhelmed by the sheer number of platforms, each offering unique content. Tracking favorite shows and movies across multiple services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime can be confusing and time-consuming. With no unified system to help users keep track of release dates, new episodes, or recommendations from different platforms, viewers often miss out on important content.</p>
                <p>Uniplay addresses this issue by offering a one-stop hub where users can follow and track shows and movies, regardless of the streaming platform they originate from.</p>
            </section>

                <h2>Recommended Solution</h2>
                <p>The solution to this problem is the development of Uniplay, a platform designed to unify content tracking across various streaming services. Uniplay allows users to search, follow, and receive updates on their favourite shows and movies all in one place.</p>
                <p>By aggregating information such as release dates, episode reminders, and even personalized recommendations, Uniplay simplifies the user experience, eliminating the need to jump between multiple apps or websites. The platform will not provide direct streaming but will link users to the correct platform to watch content, while serving as a central location for following all shows and movies of interest.</p>

                <p>This centralization saves users time and effort while reducing the chances of missing important content. Additionally, by following all their media preferences in one place, users may also discover new recommendations based on their interests.
