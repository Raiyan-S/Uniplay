            "The internet might be a convenience, but it hasn't yet, for me, been a fundamental reordering. These things
            are supposed to be time-savers, so you have more time standing at your easel if you so choose."

        <!-- Problem Definition Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
            <p>In today’s streaming landscape, users are overwhelmed by the sheer number of platforms, each offering
                unique content. Tracking favorite shows and movies across multiple services such as Netflix, Hulu, and
                Amazon Prime can be confusing and time-consuming. With no unified system to help users keep track of
                release dates, new episodes, or recommendations from different platforms, viewers often miss out on
                important content.</p>
            <p>Uniplay addresses this issue by offering a one-stop hub where users can follow and track shows and
                movies, regardless of the streaming platform they originate from.</p>

        <!-- Recommended Solution Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Recommended Solution</h2>
            <p>The solution to this problem is the development of Uniplay, a platform designed to unify content tracking
                across various streaming services. Uniplay allows users to search, follow, and receive updates on their
                favourite shows and movies all in one place.</p>
            <p>By aggregating information such as release dates, episode reminders, and even personalized
                recommendations, Uniplay simplifies the user experience, eliminating the need to jump between multiple
                apps or websites. The platform will not provide direct streaming but will link users to the correct
                platform to watch content, while serving as a central location for following all shows and movies of
                interest.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Benefits Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Benefits of the Provided Solution</h2>
            <p>The main benefit of Uniplay is the streamlined and simplified user experience. By consolidating the
                process of tracking content across multiple platforms, users can efficiently stay up-to-date with their
                favourite shows and movies without the hassle of visiting different streaming services individually.</p>
            <p>This centralization saves users time and effort while reducing the chances of missing important content.
                Additionally, by following all their media preferences in one place, users may also discover new
                recommendations based on their interests. Uniplay thus enhances content management, offering convenience
                and improved content discovery for users.</p>
